Key Purpose of Ejs:

EJS works by allowing us to write JavaScript(ejs tags) inside HTML. The server injects data into the template and renders a complete HTML page with dynamic content, which is then sent to the browser like a ready-made HTML page.
        1. Ejs runs on the server.
        2. It gets dynamic values from the backend(/api) into html template.
        3. Then it sends the final complate html to the browser side(/client side renders).
        4. The browser renders the ready made html template - no need js to populate the content.

        cons:
            1. not faster, need to reload for everychange.
            2. not api friendly, like we can't change much. if we need we use(/ajax).

Pure html works:
        1. html loads first, then js loads the dynamic data(/browser).
        2. api friendly bcz its comes as json so it takes that and builds its own HTML.
        3. good for dynamic updates - dom will update withut reloading.

        cons:
            1. need js to render the content - without js page shows nothing.
